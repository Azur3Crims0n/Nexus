        <h2>The Hero's Party</h2>
        <img class="image1" src="HeroPartyTeam.png" alt="One smug blonde male in expensive looking designer armor standing beside a stoic purple haird woman and a pink haired woman with a devilish smirk.">
      <p>There are two main parties to focus on in Backup Hero, the Hero's Party and the Backup Heroes. The Hero's Party consists of the top three people who were summoned to this world on a specific night by a certian king.
        <br>The party consists of three people; Naomi Hinode, Toya Shimizu, and Rika Ito. These three had been chosen by their summoned country and several others to defeat the demon king, going around gaining strength and support from other kingdoms and countries to further their goals.
        <br> Each party member has their own personal goals and reasoning for staying with the party and getting closer to defeating the very threat they were summoned to subdue.
        <br> The leader would end up being the only male in the party, Toya Shimizu. He was a capable fighter, but struggled when he took lots of damage; which is why they had their resident healer and charmer, Rika Ito. She was very skilled at manipulationa and her support magic abilities, but cound not dish out damage herself. She mostly relied on her followers to do things for her, but if she couldn't she went to the last member of the party; Naomie Hinode. She was a stoic girl who tried to look at the world with basic values and an almost bland idea of how everything worked.
        <br>The party's ultimate mission is to defeat the Demon Lord. Traveling the world until they finally are strong enough to come face to face with him.
