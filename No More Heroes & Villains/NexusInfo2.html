        <p>Was brought to this world with his College class. Known to his classmates as the Tutorial Administrator and to adventurers as the Backup Jack. He's known to be kind and help all those he can, whether the issue be small or large. He almost always wears a smile and enjoys putting a smile on other's faces as well.
  
          “Well, everyone deserves to be given a chance and treated with kindness. After all, were all poeple here, so whats the harm in a little good will?”

        <h4>Physical Description on Hero</h4>
        <p>He's an average sized young man who wears a persistant bright, friendly expression. His hair is hazel brown and always well kept, making his friendly aura even more inviting.
          <br>
            He wears a simple shirt and pants you can find just about anywhere, keeping his looks on the more average side of the spectrum. His light and minimal armor covered the very basics and didn't look all that uncomfortable, keeping his simplistic look quite uniform. Keeping his bow in hand and readied, his spell prepared as the light refracts off and casts shadows over the contours of his body, his eyes staying vigilent for danger at all times - he prepared himself for battle.</p>
