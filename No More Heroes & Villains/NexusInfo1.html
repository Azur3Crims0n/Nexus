      <p>He was originally created by Rin Shanguhai, but managed to escape after Rin was caught up in a fight while catching new people to experiment on. Not known by most as anything important. Just the weird guy down the street who some believe to be a robot spy from an enemy kingdom.

      <h4>Physical Description on Hero</h4>
      <p>GHOST stands tall and imposing, his frame sleek yet subtly armored, built for both agility and resilience. His body is a fusion of matte-black alloy and carbon fiber plating, with faint circuitry lines glowing faintly beneath the surface—like veins of light pulsing with artificial life.
        <br>
        <br>
        A long, weathered hooded cloak drapes over his shoulders, concealing much of his form and helping him blend into human crowds. The cloak is tattered at the edges, soaked from the rain, and carries the weight of his journey. Beneath it, his limbs are jointed with precision engineering, giving him a fluid, almost human-like grace.
        <br>
        <br>
        His face is a mask—smooth, metallic, and expressionless—save for two piercing, glowing blue eyes that shine through the darkness. These eyes are his most striking feature, radiating intelligence, sorrow, and a growing spark of something more… emotion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Small details hint at his past: a scorched panel on his left arm from his escape, a serial number partially scratched off his chest plate, and a hidden compartment in his forearm that once held tools for experimentation. Every part of him tells a story—of captivity, escape, and the slow awakening of something deeply human.</p>
