        <p>He's the most well known party member of the party Backup Hero, but not in a positive light. He is known as the cruelest member, having the capability to empathize but refusing to. He was given the nickname Souless Solo, in refrence to him being a one man army and his tendency to only do what is neccecary. He rarely considers the unnecessary and will always strive to be even stronger.
  
          “I'm not a hero anymore. Just the enemy of your enemy.”

        <h4>Physical Description on Hero</h4>
        <p>He wears a black, form-fitting hooded top that matches his practical and understated style. The dark color palette enhances his intimidating aura, allowing him to blend into shadows or strike fear into opponents with minimal effort. His overall appearance gives off the energy of a disciplined anti-hero—reserved, calculating, and dangerous. A glowing blue system panel hovers beside him, hinting at previous his existence within a Webtoon-like world, and suggesting that he is more than just a man.
          <br>
          <br>
          He has piercing crimson-orange eyes with a sharp, narrow shape that immediately draw attention and convey intense focus. His eyebrows are sharply angled, enhancing the naturally serious and commanding expression he carries. A well-defined jawline and a straight, symmetrical nose add to his stoic appearance, giving him a presence that is both striking and controlled. His mouth is usually set in a firm line, rarely betraying emotion, further reinforcing his disciplined and unshakable demeanor.
          <br>
          <br>
          His jet-black hair is long and thick, tied back in a high ponytail that allows for ease of movement while still maintaining a slightly wild edge. Stray strands and sharp, pointed bangs frame his face, accentuating the intensity of his features. The hair has a smooth, well-kept texture, hinting either at personal care or natural resilience. Overall, his hairstyle adds to his visual identity as a lone warrior, blending discipline with an untamed energy.
          <br>
          <br>
          He possesses a lean yet muscular build, clearly the result of rigorous physical conditioning. His physique favors agility and speed without sacrificing strength, making him well-suited for close-quarters combat or evasive maneuvers. His posture is upright and deliberate, projecting confidence and constant vigilance. His hands are strong and agile, with defined fingers that suggest precision and control, whether in battle or technical tasks. Broad shoulders and a sturdy neck further emphasize his readiness for confrontation.
