        <p>Known as the “Black Current”, Rin loves to create chaos, of any form. He’s willing to experiment on anyone who seems interesting enough to him.

          “Stay down, <i>the experiment isn’t over yet.</i>”
          </p>
        
        <br>
        <h4>Physical Description on Villain</h4>
        <p>He’s a tall, sharp-featured man with wild, silver-white hair that juts out in thick, uneven spikes. His expression is hard and focused, eyes narrowed under a strong brow, giving off an air of quiet intensity. His skin is pale, made even starker by the electric-blue glow reflecting off his face.
          <br>
          <br>
            He wears a long, dark coat with a high collar that rises to his jawline. The coat hugs his broad frame and flares slightly at the bottom, catching in the breeze. One arm is outstretched, fingers clawed as arcs of lightning crackle from his hand, casting jagged shadows across his coat. His stance is steady and grounded — confident, almost defiant — as if he’s used to power and unbothered by its consequences.
          <br>  
          <br>
            There’s a storm in him, barely contained, and it shows in every line of his posture. He towers over the city, as if he's in full control.</p>
