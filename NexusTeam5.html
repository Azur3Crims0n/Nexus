        <h2>Important Unaffiliated Characters</h2>
        <p>There are many characters in this story that don't belong to a certain group, but most of them don't have a specific afiliation.
          <br>This list doesn't hold many members aside from one who forms a sort of group after the events of this story for poeple similar to himself. Making their own one man group. It also includes another important character that is quite mysterious and doesn't have much known about them. Anarachy&Parity.
          <br>For the person who made their own one man group, the goal was simple at first. Take out the organization known as Archthrall, afterwards it became to make sure that people similar to the founder or who couldn't find their place in the normal world had a safe place. Anarachy&Parity had near no connectiont o him though, never even directly meeting most other characters on this list. They were a higher being mostly unkown to both the world itself and the audience. The only important and known information about it, is that this character was Jin Seiji's patron and that Jin was the only one who could know what they were saying or doing.
          <br>The leader of the "Specter", a solo organization formed out of personal interest, is one who's only purpose was fufilled, now wishing himself to become more human so that he may himself find another purpose. GH-0-ST is a robot made out of advanced mechanical tech, he has severe truama from his creation to the end of this arc, which continues into every portion of the continuing story. He invites a select few into his organization, and gets wholely regected. Leaving him to opporate it on his own and follow his quest.
          <br>This is a group of unaffiliates, meaning their values and goals can vary. In this case, we only have two. GH-0-ST, who's goal was to take out Archthrall and save those cast out by others. Then there's Anarchy&Parity who's motives are unkown.
        </p>
