        <h2>Archthrall</h2>
        <img class="image1" src="ArchthrallTeam.png" alt="A lean man with white hair and lightning stands beside a man who seems to belong to some sort of mafia-like group.">
        <p>There are many villainous organizations throughout the story of Backup Hero, our main focus will be on a group called Archthrall.
          <br>This organization only consists of two people; Rin Shanguhai and Keijiro Takimoto. Residents of this world who ended up in this twisted position of villiany.
          <br>They didn't seem to have common goals, merely ones that coincided with each other at the moment. They were ready to throw the other way and feed them to the wolves if it came down to it. This organization held strong enough for it to become a governmental issue, an organized crime syndicate with many branches, making the leader nearly untracable.
          <br>The one who could be the acclaimed leader woudl be Rin Shanguhai, a ruthless man who considers himself a scientist. He uses live human subjects in his experiments, torturing them as he sees nececary. He allows one other to be included in his "team", Keijiro Takimoto. This was an enigma of a person, one who simply craved violence at any cost. He had no further goal other than to hurt others for his own entertainment. These two are the main heads of the orginization known as Archthrall.
          <br>The end goal of Archthrall is to take over the world. To rule over it, starting with the underground and criminal face, before moving into the public and truly taking over the world.
