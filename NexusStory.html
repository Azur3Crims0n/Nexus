        <h2>The Archthrall-Arc of Backup Heroes.</h2>
        <p><i>So, you want to hear a story, eh?</i></p>
        <p>I got a good one for you...<p>
        <p>Jin walked around the streets wondering what crime syndicate had the strength and follow up to pressure the government this much. He’d taken their offer almost right away, he didn’t need to negotiate higher pay or less work. He just needed to get stronger. By the time he’d be wandering the streets, Jin already had a plan. He walked for three days, refusing to rest aside from occasionally looking into a nearby inn to keep tabs on the customers. Day two, the young clerk had disappeared, nobody seemed to know. As to what was going on, Jin really didn’t care. As he walked up to the counter, he could hear three muffled voices. Two from the floor below, another from the employee only area behind the desk. Naturally, Jin walked up to the door and kicked it, splintering the door as its pieces fly everywhere.
          <br>“The girl, where is she?” The statement was clear, no room for interpretation, not in this situation. His voice, smooth and simple, had given a demand that was quite concerning afterwards. His eyes quickly dart to the corner of the room, a young woman with her clothes torn. Her body was majorly exposed, threads of what used to be her clothing still upon her body as only her undergarments were to hide herself, even those seemed to be fighting for their lives. Jin walked past all of these criminals, taking his cloak and wrapping the poor clerc.
          <br>“Now you owe me, so you’ll tell me everything you need to know about Archthrall. I don’t care what you tell me, unless you founded it you aren’t my current target.” Jin said, his gaze never wandering from his eyes. 
          <br>“Hey! That's our girl! Go find your own woman to-” The criminal was quickly cut off and silenced when a quill pierced his throat. Jin’s gaze was cold and stern. He clearly didn’t care. Looking between the woman and them, noticing the brand they all held.
          <br>“Who can tell me the most on Archthrall? Whoever gives me the least information or the least valuable, dies. We continue until I get what I want.” He sits next to the clerk, calm as can be. He crosses his legs and waits. The criminals look between each other, then him. He sighs, turning to the girl. 
          <br>“Which of them did this? Which tore your clothes?” He said, voice not shaking. The clerk pointed to one with a hand trembling with fear and trauma. Quickly another quill pierces their hands. Jin smirked, grin evil and sadistic as he lands three quills through his throat. The smirk on his face told them to speak. Each of them sings like a canary as Jin picks them off one by one. Soon there was only one of them left. By this point, Jin had let the clerk get dressed privately in another room and continue her job as if nothing had happened. He grabs the last criminal by the collar and walks out to the front floor. Screams could still be heard downstairs. Sobbing hysterically and desperate. Jin sighed and tossed the criminal onto a table where adventurers were waiting. As they stood to scream, a flash of recognition comes across their face. The Soulless Solo. They understood this criminal was now under their supervision whether they liked it or not. The Soulless Solo was not one to be tested. They overheard him asking about a basement of some sort with the clerk, but they were to absorbed in the criminal being thrown they didn’t process any of it. Suddenly, Jin smashes the floor below him, falling into the large floor below. Everyone was astonished besides the clerk. Jin put his hands into his pocket with a disappointed sigh as he falls. He looks down to see many woman who had all had the same thing happen to them that would've happened to the clerk. He closes his eyes in whispers an apology as he hits the ground. 
          <br>“I apologize. I arrived too late. Allow me to make it up to you via leaving no survivors.” Jin lands with a kneel, his head looking down even as he stands. All of the criminals stopped to look at him. The one who was presumably the leader of the troupe spoke out.
          <br>“Oh please, as if somebody as clearly poor as you, could end up dealing any sort of damage to us. Kill him so we can continue to have our fun.” The group throws all the girls to the side and begin to charge him at the same time. He scoffs, shaking his head and slowly opening his eyes. A sadistic grin appeared on his face, from ear to ear as his eyes finally gain a glean of their orange light. He was ready and rarring to go. The group wasn't stupid and go one by one, but Jin was used to this an expected it. He ducks down as they all throw a punch and he sweeps most of them, getting stopped on the last few. Quickly he jumps back, purposefully stepping on a few of the ones who fell. They took out daggers, swords, and maces. This didn't deter Jin at all. He dusts off his shoulder as he confidently walks calmly and casually towards his new opposition. One decides to rush in on his own, dual daggers in hand. First swing, a slash towards Jin's stomach. He pushes the criminal's arm to the side, making it so that he didn't get hit and in the same motion, knees the poor criminal's jaw and extends his leg to kick his instead. Jin continues his assult, throwing a flurry of blows strong enough to take out even the most hardened of these criminals. 
          <br>“Why are you going at him one at a time!? Kill him already!” The criminals seemed to regain their lost confidendence, not even remembering the moment they lost it in the fight between the two combatants. Jin smirks and begins to sprint after picking up the daggers the earlier criminal. He throws one, landing right inside one of their shoulders. As they reach to take it out, Jin is already in front of them and in the air, landing directly on them and plungnig the knife between their eyes. Jin jumps off his chest and punches the next criminal. The ensueing fight only lasted about five minutes. Damage showed how one sided this entire fight was. Jin was left with one self inflicted wound due to his own carelessness. The criminals, all dead aside from the leader, who now rose to face him alone.
          <br>“What? Did you not think you'd have the chance to face me? Neither did I, and yet here are.” He let his tongue glide against a poor woman's cheek before throwing her to the side by her neck. “Now to invite yourself in at such an inopportune time and cause a ruckus is quite rude, don't you thing?” Jin quickly tosses another dagger towards the leader who blocked it with a large and intricate greatsword with clear magical properties. 
          <br>“Mad I caught you with your pants down? Maybe next time you should learn no means no. Otherwise you'll face me.” The booming laughter shook the ribcage of every woman in the room, Jin however, was unfased. 
          <br>“Bring it pretty boy. You'll sell for quite a lot with skills like those.” The perverted leader licks his lips greedily. 
          <br>“I hope so, otherwise changing my bones wasn't worth it at all.” Jin is suddenly covered in a cocoon of wood. The leader scoffs as his sword bursts into flames and he swings his sword at the wood cocoon. It doesn't catch on fire, instead, it sits there as if nothing had happened. Attempt after attempt, nothing burned the cocoon. The leader, in blind rage, threw his greatsword with the intent for it to cleave one of the women in two. He heard it smash into the wall without hitting a single person. He turns to find all of the woman are gone. None of them were there where he'd left them. Slowly realization dawned on him.
          <br>“Figure it out yet?” Jin said, he was beside the leader, who swung his fist.
