          <br>
          Takumi wields a finely crafted wooden longbow, designed for both distance and accuracy. He carries a round wooden shield reinforced with a steel rim and boss for added defense. His arrows are tipped with a potion coat, suggesting that he uses poison and potion effects in combat.
