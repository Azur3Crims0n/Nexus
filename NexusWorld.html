        <h4>Welcome to Nexus.</h4>
        <p>This is our Worldbuilding and Background page for the Rin arc of <i>Backup Hero&#8482;</i>. Here you will learn important terms and the backstory of the events that happen within the story itself.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>World Buildilng</h4>
        <p>This world is fairly simple if you watch anime. It’s your standard fantasy world, elves, dwarves, humans, orcs, fae, the works. The world is diverse in its technological advancements, but for the most part, they are not as well developed as we are in that regard. There are several different countries and continents and kingdoms, but our main focus on this arc is the kingdom of Thalbesh in the country of Rysgard, on the continent Galiheim. The idea in this continent is that an area is called a country, usually this area is under a pact of sorts that allows for stability and conflict to stay equal. These details are of later importance. In a specific country, like Rysgard, there exist differing rules but most of which stay the same. The main point of these rules is to keep relations on terms in which when another country threatens Rysgard, they are not without the ability to fight. Some specific terms that will be of importance to the Rin arc we are currently focusing on would be “Bazsent”,  “Mirye”, and “Rexhold”. The first term, “Bazsent” is a country wide law assuring the safety of merchants and allowing them safe passage between kingdoms, even if there is war. They were special armbands and identifications that show they are merchant personnel and are allowed to trade with others without harm coming to them. The second is “Mirye”, which states that each country should have a military for internal affairs, external affairs, and a combined military using their best people that is used in wars with other countries. The last term is “Rexhold” which just handles succession in the case of a kingdom taking over another kingdom. It is referenced but not in depth with the story so it is not necessary to know.</p>
        <p>Now, we do need to have a bit of background information before the main story becomes relevant. Firstly, the anime Backup Heroes has a premise that is not standard to other anime. The main characters themselves are considered a backup party for a group of heroes. They will be henceforth referred to as the title, Backup Heroes, or by their name directly. The people referred to as Main Characters or the Heroes will be another group whose entire goal is to defeat a demon king, like a standard anime. This anime is an isekai, the character Takumi Fritz was summoned along with his entire college class to this world. Their purpose of being summoned was to defeat a demon lord. The hero trio was a part of this summoned group as well as Takumi Fritz, who met the rest of the Backup Heroes at a later date, separate from the summoning.</p>

        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>
          In the lead up to the story I do have to tell a small tale. It is focused on the Hero party. This takes place in Thalbesh. Two characters, Naomi Hinode and Rika Ito were doing some shopping for their party. Toya Shimizu was haggling at an inn, trying to get a good price for rooms. As they wandered around, looking through shops and the like, trying to find equipment. Rika spots a white haired male who seemed like an easy mark. She was one of those people who would seduce and manipulate anyone and everyone she could, her abilities even enhancing this prospect. Naomi on the other hand was a more stoic personality. Rika started to make her way to this new person, figuring she can coax him into paying for them instead of wasting their own money. 
          The closer they got, the more off put Naomi started to feel. The look in his eye, the way he carried himself, his posture, his body, none of it felt quite right to her. She turned to Rika to say something but she had already set him as her target, nearly nothing Naomi could say would deter her at this point. With a cautious sigh, she followed her up to this new person. He quickly introduced himself as Rin Shanguhai, a scientist. His smile was wide and his eyes seemed very interested in the two girls. Rika did everything she could to keep his attention, making use of her charm and flaunting her body in both subtle and not-so subtle ways. After some talking, Naomi decided she didn’t like this guy. Something about his smile seemed fake, and his interest disturbed. Rin took notice, his eyes moving from Rika and her show, to Naomi. His gaze was piercing, cold wasn’t the right word to describe it. It felt like it jolted through her, a sense of impending sent through every nerve ending. She had to get out of there. 
          So with little word, she turned and left the two alone, heading back to the inn where Toya was. As Rika wandered the shops with her newfound patron, Naomi was questioned by Toya. He gave a near interrogation of who this man was and what he was doing with Rika, his jealous nature shining through. Naomi answered everything with exasperation, not really caring for how he treated and saw women, but she also would’ve liked him to make sure that Rika was okay and safe. She didn’t want to admit as much, but she did care for her party members. They may not be the best people, a little too selfish for heroes, but this position was thrust upon them so she sympathized. Quickly after Naomi finished answering his every question, he gathered the basics of his beaten and battered equipment and headed out. She took note that he took his sword but not his shield, knowing that if a fight breaks out he’d come back with a few bruises at the very least. 
          Rika had already made use of her newfound toy. Using him to buy a few items and indulge in herself a bit. She saw Toya approaching her from down the street, his eyes frantic and rage filled. She lets out a sigh and clings closely to Rin. The first thing Toya does is start aggravating Rin. He makes snide comments and begins to pull Rika away. Every word making Rin more and more angry. Until he finally breaks character. He states that he is done pretending and that he’s just going to take them by force if they won't come with him by choice. This puts Rika off, finally realizing what Naomi’s intuition spotted. Cursing under her breath she asks what he means and what his intentions are. His smile grows, this time a very real and wicked grin; telling the two heroes that he plans to use them in his fun experiments, whether they wanted to or not. This was all the indication that Toya needs, he quickly draws his sword and swings at Rin. 
          Without missing a beat, he takes a step back, dodging the sword. He lets out a villainous laugh before sending a jolt of high voltage lightning towards Toya. The sword attracts the attack, but it still sends a heavy shock through his body. Toya flies backwards into Rika, sending them a few feet back. She quickly starts healing his wounds as he stands up, facing his new enemy. They lock eyes and Toya readies himself, his feet digging into the ground and his sword raised. Rin slowly approaches, using his lightning to generate a crackling bowstaff. A battle ensues, Rin dominating the fight as he dodges every simple attack Toya could throw. As the combat continues, the street gets destroyed. Naomi, who had no idea of the sudden fight, was starting to get worried. 
          She knew of Toya’s tendency to escalate things, but she was also uncomfortable with that man. All this combined with how long they’d been gone, something wasn’t right. She quickly gathered her gear, along with Toya’s shield. Knowing he was lucky to be with Rika, a well regarded healer. Although she was confident in her party’s combat prowess, she had a stark feeling that the man named Rin also had such experience, maybe more. She was rushed as she ran through the streets to find them. Ultimately finding the two beaten and battered. Rika, nearly out of mana entirely and without her legion of pawns. Toya, half dead, burns and bruises across nearly his entire body. 
          They both turned to her, horror stricken face. Reprieve washed over them, knowing she was the most capable of the group on their own. She readied her weapon, taking the chains in hand and holding the handles of her Kusarigama, lighting crackling through them. Rin’s smile only grew, voicing his hope that she’ll be able to keep her more entertained than her party members. She started with a wide swing, electrifying the blade and chain. Rin dodges, her move easily telegraphed, but he left himself open. Unknown to him, she’d launched lances made of the same electricity running through her weapon. He didn’t have time to dodge them both, ending up getting hit in the shoulder. She quickly retracts her first swing, going for another strike with her other Kusarigama. She notices a child who may end up getting hit or shocked by her lighting imbuement, quickly throwing the attack off course to avoid hitting him. Rin takes quick notice of this habit, letting more civilians and children come between them and even use them to be his shield or used to create openings. 
          After a long fight, he manages to capture Naomi, his smile was wide as he enjoyed the combat-mage put up. As he takes the trio to his base, he finds that his creation, GH-0-ST, had escaped while he was fighting. Keijiro had fallen asleep drunk on the couch. Maybe a month later, GH-0-ST ends up finding 2/3rds of the Backup Heroes, only missing Jin Seiji, who happens to be wandering the town where he first escaped. Looking for Keijiro and Rin for a reason widely unknown to most.
